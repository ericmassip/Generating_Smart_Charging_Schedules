    "In this section, we intend to present the analysis of our data. We will focus on the main characteristics of our environment (i.e. arrival times, departure times, idle times, etc.). Our aim is to compare it with previous work like in *Paper 2* and *Paper 3*. The last part of this section tries to describe the behaviour observed from the EnergyVille PV data and how it can be exploited in our approach. The ElaadNL dataset needs not to be studied because it is already analyzed in *Paper 2* and *Paper 3*.\n",

    "First of all, it is important to have present that our environment is an example of a *charge near work* cluster. This means that the transactions available in our data have been generated by workers from EnergyVille, who have completed transactions making use of the charging stations from the parking lot. Belonging to the *charge near work* cluster already gives us an idea of the characteristics that the transactions will have, but nevertheless we are going to proceed with the analysis to confirm assumed hypothesis and encounter possible anomalies.\n",
