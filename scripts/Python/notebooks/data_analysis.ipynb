The last part of this section tries to describe the behaviour observed from the EnergyVille PV data and how it can be exploited in our approach. The ElaadNL dataset needs not to be studied because it is already analyzed in *Paper 2* and *Paper 3*.\n",

This means that the transactions available in our data have been generated by workers from EnergyVille, who have completed transactions making use of the charging stations from the parking lot. Belonging to the *charge near work* cluster already gives us an idea of the characteristics that the transactions will have, but nevertheless we are going to proceed with the analysis to confirm assumed hypothesis and encounter possible anomalies.\n",

    "These graphs show us the power flow from the start of the transaction to the end. The y axis represents the amount of power in Watts and the x axis represents the time of connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions 1 to 5 (i.e. top 2, middle 2 and bottom-left) are examples of finished transactions. Transaction 6 (i.e. bottom-right) is an example of unfinished transaction. From these graphs we can accurately describe the behaviour of the power flow since the start of the transaction until the end of it: right after the EV is plugged in the level of power reaches a maximum level and stays there for a certain period of time based on the level of charging of the EV. When the battery is close to being fully charged, the level of power starts decreasing until it reaches 0 W so the EV is charged. Nevertheless, we can conclude that it is not possible to predict the state of charge of an EV once a transaction starts, without knowing the battery capacity, just the current level of power, because the level of power is not proportional to the state of charge, on the contrary, it maintains a stable level for most of the duration of the transaction and then it decreases significantly fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction 4 (i.e. medium-right) has 2 different characteristics from the rest of transactions. The level of power it reaches is 6500 W, while the other transactions not even get to 3500 W. This is most likely due to the fact that the user used a different EV that day, with different features and a different battery capacity. The second interesting characteristic is that, after the level of power decreases and it finally reaches 0 W, it increases and decreases a few times. That is precisely one of the reasons why, in our algorithm to estimate the end of charging time described in section 1.4, we make sure that the level of power stays at 0 W for a minimum of 30 minutes. This way we avoid estimating an incorrect end of charging time."
